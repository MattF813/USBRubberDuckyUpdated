##About
One day while working on a DuckyScript I realized how annoying it is to test DuckyScripts. I few hours later this project was born.
Right now the toolkit allows you to test your code by emulating what the ducky would do, a validator which can look at your code before you run it and tell you if there is compile errors and finally a easy-encoder which can encode a txt file to bin for you by clicking 1-button instead of going through CMD.
